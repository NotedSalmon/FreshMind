Process:
This has been my first individual Kotlin project for university. The plan is to create an app that I would use to keep track of all my tasks and make myself accountable. As I have had previous experience of Kotlin, it was simple to get the basic functonality to work such as UI and basic user functionality.
The bigger strugles of this project was deciding a Database to use as I had only used SQLite but wanted to try using Firebase for the first time. This did not go well and resulted in me wasting a good week of progress. Instead I obted for using Firebase to store the users feedback which I can later view in a website I made using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
The Calendar implementation has also been hard as I had never implemented a third party library which caused challenges however taught me a lot.

The project is a work in progress which means a lot of the features have not been implemented yet and there is always room for improvement.
